# Kajamite

Portable, evidence-aware knowledge infrastructure for agents.

Kajamite is a reusable knowledge engine for Python applications, command-line
clients, and optional MCP servers. It preserves ordinary Markdown while adding
evidence, scope, revision history, lifecycle maintenance, and inspectable reuse
decisions for governed claims. Basic Memory supplies storage, search, and graph
discovery through its public interface.

A namespace is an ordinary directory. Work with one note or several, link related
knowledge, and preserve useful context across applications and conversations.

## Install

The Python knowledge engine has no runtime dependencies: install it with
`pip install .` from this checkout. Install the `basic-memory` extra for that
backend adapter, or the `mcp` extra for the MCP frontend. Both extras currently
use the same MCP client/server SDK. The hashed requirements include this SDK.

Use Python 3.11 or newer on Windows or Linux. Install and configure Basic Memory
separately; this release is tested against 0.23.0. Select an existing project.
Disable Basic Memory auto-update for a version-managed deployment.

Clone this repository and create a virtual environment:

```sh
python -m venv .venv
```

Use `.venv/bin/python` on Linux or `.venv/Scripts/python.exe` on Windows:

```sh
python -m pip install --require-hashes -r requirements.lock
python -m pip install --no-deps '.[mcp]'
```

In those two commands, replace `python` with the virtual environment's interpreter.
For development with uv, `uv sync --locked --extra mcp` uses the checked-in dependency lock.

Create a private TOML configuration outside version control:

```toml
[backend]
command = "basic-memory"
args = ["mcp", "--project", "personal"]
project = "personal"
timeout = 60

[backend.env]
BASIC_MEMORY_AUTO_UPDATE = "false"
```

Replace `personal` with your existing Basic Memory project. An absolute command
path is recommended. Set `project_id` too when a UUID is needed to disambiguate
projects. Configuration executes an operator-selected command, never note content.
TOML Windows paths should use literal single-quoted strings or escaped backslashes.

Run `kajamite --config /path/to/config.toml doctor`, then register this stdio
command in your MCP client:

```text
kajamite --config /path/to/config.toml serve
```

Use the installed executable's absolute path in client configuration.
`KAJAMITE_CONFIG` is an alternative to `--config`. Keep stdio private; for remote
use, run the same command through an existing authenticated SSH connection.
Kajamite opens no network listener.

## Teach the assistant

Install [skills/kajamite/SKILL.md](skills/kajamite/SKILL.md) using your client's
project-local skill mechanism, or run `kajamite skill` to print it. The same guide
is available as the `kajamite://guide` MCP resource. No particular client plugin
or lifecycle hook is required.

The guide directs an agent to inspect existing notes, choose deliberate placement,
write for a reader and purpose, revise a coherent current account, and maintain a
bounded collection without treating a receipt or a passing check as a prose-quality
score. It includes generic editorial examples, not a required template or benchmark.
See [editorial composition and maintenance](docs/editorial-design.md) for the
source-informed design and the implemented revision and collection interfaces.

## Unified knowledge engine

`kajamite.KnowledgeEngine` supplies the shared Python operation API.
CLI and MCP operations call that engine.
Install `kajamite` for an embedded engine with a consumer-supplied backend.
Install `kajamite[basic-memory]` for its public Basic Memory client adapter.
Install `kajamite[mcp]` to expose the engine through the MCP server.

Plain notes, preferences, and proposals retain their meaning without invented verification.
Governed claims add evidence, scope, revision history, and explicit lifecycle operations.
The engine checks current records before reuse and explains withheld results.

The [engine contract](docs/engine-contract.md) defines the ownership boundary.
The [capability audit](docs/basic-memory-capability-audit.md) records observed backend features and limits.
The [record guide](docs/governance.md) describes record construction and validation.

## Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `knowledge_list` | Browse notes and child namespaces with depth and pagination |
| `knowledge_search` | Full-text search explicit namespaces with honest scan continuation |
| `knowledge_read` | Read an exact note with content bounds |
| `knowledge_context` | Gather several notes under one shared body-character budget |
| `knowledge_create` | Write supplied content/metadata into an explicit namespace |
| `knowledge_edit` | Guarded body edits and/or metadata merges |
| `knowledge_revise` | Preview or apply connected exact replacements against a complete-body hash |
| `knowledge_inspect_collection` | Live bounded ordinary-note inventory with hashes and exact-duplicate candidates |
| `knowledge_move` | Move a note or namespace through the backend |

Creation takes `namespace`, not a local filesystem directory. Search requires
`namespaces`; `recursive=true` includes descendants. `namespaces=["/"]` with
`recursive=true` selects the entire configured base. A context request takes
one namespace or a list of exact identifiers, without implicitly following links.
Use canonical returned paths, including their case. Bare note titles are not
addresses. Metadata edits merge top-level keys; supplied values replace those
keys. The backend does not support deleting keys or changing reserved
title/type/permalink fields through metadata edits.

## Mutation receipts and optional UI

Each successful create, edit, or move returns a deterministic
`knowledge_change` receipt plus a labeled `knowledge_change_text` rendering.
Receipts identify the operation and affected path, show bounded readable changed
values and metadata, include full-value hashes, state whether readback verified
the result, and label their coverage as the current Kajamite operation only.
They are evidence from the tool result, independent of the assistant's summary.

Compatible MCP Apps hosts can render the same receipt in a compact read-only
card. The packaged card makes no network requests and offers no mutation actions.
Clients without custom UI—including mobile surfaces where it is unavailable—use
the structured and labeled text result. Kajamite does not store a receipt history;
Git remains the durable backstop for all repository changes, including writes
made outside Kajamite.

`kajamite call TOOL --arguments /path/to/arguments.json` invokes the same operations
from a JSON argument file. Use `--config` before `call`. The CLI returns JSON and
a nonzero exit code on failure. Metadata does not implicitly hide notes or select a lifecycle.

## Search and context limits

Basic Memory 0.23.0 exposes no directory filter on its MCP search tool. Kajamite
therefore uses explicit **full-text** retrieval, pages through ranked results,
and matches physical file paths to the selected namespaces. Each call scans at
most five native pages of 50 results. When incomplete it returns `has_more=true`
and `next_cursor`, even if no scoped match has been found yet. Continue with the
same search arguments and cursor before concluding there are no matches.

This supports late matches without a second index or copied membership metadata.
It is not scoped semantic search, and broad sparse queries may take several
calls. Cursors are live pagination, not immutable snapshots: concurrent backend
changes can change ranking. Lists use native page pagination. Context budgets
cover note-body characters; structured metadata and listing overhead are separate.

`knowledge_inspect_collection` wraps the same bounded native retrieval with an
explicit namespace cursor, then rereads returned ordinary notes for complete-body
hashes. Its exact-duplicate candidates cover only the returned page. It reports
omissions and errors, never semantic duplication, link health, prose quality, or
collection completion before `exhausted=true`.

## Editorial evidence and limits

The [editorial design](docs/editorial-design.md) is source-informed guidance for
placement, composition, revision, and focused maintenance. It does not make a
receipt, hash, duplicate candidate, or passing test a prose-quality score.
Deterministic tests establish operation mechanics; a reader's usefulness and a
consolidation's semantic judgment remain the calling agent's and human reviewer's
responsibility. See [validation](docs/validation.md) for the distinct source,
installed-package, and native-backend evidence and its remaining limits.

## Upgrading

Version 0.2 removes the four `project_*` tools and the special `project` argument.
Use namespaces, normal note links and optional metadata instead. No note migration
runs: existing `type: project`, status values and legacy membership fields remain
readable user data. Update the skill and client tool approvals with the package.
Version 0.3 keeps those tool contracts and adds mutation receipt fields plus an
optional MCP Apps presentation; it performs no data migration.
Version 0.4 makes the unified engine the shared operation path. Install `kajamite[mcp]` for
the existing note frontend, or `kajamite` for dependency-free embedding.

## Ownership and operation

Kajamite stores no knowledge database and does not install, repoint, or delete
Basic Memory projects. The consumer owns the backend, credentials, backups,
source integrations, scheduling and durable binary artifacts. Existing folders and notes work unchanged. No namespace metadata is injected.

Cooperating writes serialize on the Kajamite host. Use one canonical host and
one shared `state_dir` for deployments addressing the same backend through
different command aliases. Direct backend tools and human editors do not honor
that lock; guarded text replacement is not universal compare-and-swap. Read
current state after an interrupted write before retrying.

Telemetry is off by default. An optional top-level `telemetry_file` path records
operation names, outcomes and durations only. Operators control its retention.
Telemetry failure never prevents knowledge access.

Uninstalling Kajamite leaves your notes and Basic Memory intact. Restore a direct
Basic Memory client connection to continue using the same Markdown.

## Development and validation

Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests` in the installed environment.
[Design and research](docs/design.md) describe the contract and limits;
[validation](docs/validation.md) records tested behavior and how to repeat it.
Tests use synthetic data in temporary directories, with no bundled knowledge corpus.

### Publication checks

Enable the local commit and push checks in each developer clone:

```sh
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
```

Run `python tools/check_publication.py HEAD` to check reachable history.
The normal test suite checks the index and available checkout history.
CI uses a shallow checkout, so local pre-push checks provide the full-history check.
These checks detect known private identifiers and selected credential, address,
and machine-path patterns. They do not replace review for private context or
comprehensive secret scanning. Commit author names and email addresses are allowed.

## Evidence-aware operations

`knowledge_record_create` persists a revision-one record in an explicit namespace.
`knowledge_record_transition` requires an expected revision and a unique operation ID.
It supports revision, dispute, revalidation, supersession, retraction, and source/dependency health changes.
`knowledge_record_maintain` marks affected dependents for review.
`knowledge_record_remove` removes one exact record and reports active-index evidence.

Reads, search, listings, and context accept `mode="reuse"` or `mode="inspect"`.
Governed reuse requires matching `request_scope` and an injected source checker.
The default CLI has no source-specific checker, so it withholds governed claims from reuse.
Inspection remains available. Consumers can construct the engine with their own policy callbacks.

`knowledge_search` accepts `item_types` and observation `categories`.
`knowledge_related` discovers native graph neighbors within explicit namespaces.
For configured semantic retrieval, set `backend.semantic_search=true` and select `retrieval_mode="semantic"` or `"hybrid"`.
Kajamite does not configure or download an embedding model.

## Compact change feedback

Mutation results include a compact read-only card on compatible MCP Apps hosts.
Select **View changes** for previous/current values and optional technical evidence.
The card requests fullscreen when supported and otherwise opens details inline.
Maintenance, preview, replay, partial completion, and failure have distinct states.
See [change presentation](docs/change-presentation.md) for coverage and host limits.

### Configurable change UI

The bundled shadcn interface accepts adopter themes without a frontend build.
See [UI theming](docs/ui-theming.md) for tweakcn exports and embedding configuration,
and [UI development](web/README.md) for the package build.
